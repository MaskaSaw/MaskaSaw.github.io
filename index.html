		<h1> Some information about me:</h1>

			<p class="bottom-text">
			Since my early childhood i always wanted to become a professional paleontologist. I was very dissapointed when i realised that such a profession have no popularity in Belarus, soÂ the only chance to became a succesfull specialist is to leave this country and go somewhere else. So that's why i started trying my powers in other directions, which contained music, writing, sports and finally programming. It was the most interesting and exciting way to find myself, especially because i always was a fan of computer games. That is how my story began.

			<p class="bottom-text-add">
			Now I am 20 years old, studying at the 3rd course of BSUIR. I have some experience working with such programming languages as Delphi, C, C++ (especially WinAPI), C# (.NET), Java, JS, PHP and Python. I have not enough skill to call myself an experienced software engeneer as i want to be, but i think that everything is in my hands, so every day i try to find out something new and interesting in programming, get new information and improve myself at all. I want to become a professional in my direction, that's why i'm here.
